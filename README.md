I'm learning a ton about [dotfiles, command line use, Homebrew, zsh, git, macOS and more with the course ***Dotfiles from Start to Finish-ish***](http://dotfiles.eieio.xyz/) by [@EIEIOxyz](https://twitter.com/EIEIOxyz/), and you can too!


## TODO
- Terminal Preferences
- Changed Shell to ZSH
- Dock Preferences
- Mission Control Preference (don't rearrange spaces)
- Finder Show Path Bar
- Trackpad (Three Finger Drag and Tap to Click)
- .zshrc
- Git (config and SSH)
- Share this repo with a million people
